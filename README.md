# VCSwiftTookit
This is a collection of classes and extensions written in Swift 3 to help you optimize your time when developing iOS applications.
All the code was done by me, so please if you think you can contribute, lets share some thoughts!

When I get some time I will update this with detailed description of each class / method.

Soon this will be available on Cocoapods, so you won't need to manually install it.

For now, here's how to use it:

# Installing
- Clone this on you Mac
- Run 'pod install' on the cloned project

# Using it on your project
- Add the following lines to your project's Podfile:

pod 'QRCode'

- Run 'pod install' on your project
- Open the VCSwiftToolkit.xcworkspace
- Copy the group "Sources" to your project on Xcode
